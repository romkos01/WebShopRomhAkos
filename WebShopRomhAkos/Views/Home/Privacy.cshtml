    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Welcome to the privacy policy for the MVC Test Application, a project created by Romhányi Ákos for portfolio demonstration purposes. This application is designed as a showcase of my skills and is not intended for commercial use. This policy outlines the handling of any data collected during your visit to this test application.</p>

    <h3>Data Collection</h3>
    <p>This MVC Test Application does not collect any personal data from its users. If the application collects non-personal data for demonstration purposes (like analytics), it will be clearly stated.</p>

    <h3>Data Usage</h3>
    <p>Any non-personal data collected (e.g., page visits, session duration) is solely for demonstration purposes to showcase functionality within the application. No data is used for commercial purposes or shared with third parties.</p>

    <h3>Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h3>
    <p>This test application currently does not use cookies or similar tracking technologies. Should we decide to use these technologies in the future, they will not be utilized for collecting personal data, but rather to enhance user experience and analyze application performance.</p>

    <h3>Data Protection Rights</h3>
    <p>As this is a test application, it does not store or process personal data. However, if there were any concerns regarding privacy, users are welcome to contact me at romkos0630@gmail.com.</p>

    <h3>Security Measures</h3>
    <p>While this application does not handle sensitive data, standard security practices are implemented to ensure the integrity of any non-personal data.</p>

    <h3>Contact Information</h3>
    <p>For any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please contact Romhányi Ákos at romkos0630@gmail.com.</p>

    <h3>Policy Modifications</h3>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time. Any changes will be reflected on this page.</p>
